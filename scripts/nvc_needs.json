    "title": "Understanding Universal Human Needs",
    "content": "In NVC, NEEDS are understood as the universal life energy that motivates all human action. Understanding needs is central to NVC practice.\n\nKEY PRINCIPLES ABOUT NEEDS:\n\n1. NEEDS ARE UNIVERSAL\nEvery human being shares the same basic needs. While strategies for meeting needs vary by culture and individual, the needs themselves are universal. This universality is what makes connection across differences possible.\n\n2. NEEDS ARE NEVER IN CONFLICT\nWhen people are in conflict, it's their strategies that conflict, not their needs. Two people might have the same need (e.g., respect) but different strategies for meeting it. Shifting focus from strategies to needs opens creative possibilities.\n\n3. FEELINGS SIGNAL NEEDS\n- Pleasant feelings (joy, peace, excitement) signal that needs ARE being met\n- Unpleasant feelings (sadness, anger, fear) signal that needs are NOT being met\nFeelings are messengers pointing us toward what we need.\n\n4. NEEDS VS STRATEGIES\n- Needs are the underlying motivations (connection, autonomy, safety)\n- Strategies are specific ways to meet needs (calling a friend, taking a walk, locking the door)\nProblems arise when we confuse strategies with needs or insist on one specific strategy.\n\n5. ALL ACTIONS ARE ATTEMPTS TO MEET NEEDS\nEven actions we judge as 'wrong' are attempts to meet needs. This doesn't make all actions equally effective or beautiful, but it helps us maintain empathy and connection.\n\n6. NEEDS CAN BE MET IN MANY WAYS\nFor any need, there are countless strategies. Freedom comes from recognizing this - we're never dependent on one person or situation to meet our needs.\n\nCategories of needs: Connection, Physical Wellbeing, Honesty, Play, Peace, Autonomy, Meaning.",
